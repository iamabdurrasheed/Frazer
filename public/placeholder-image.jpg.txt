# Placeholder Image
This file represents a placeholder image for the e-commerce application.
In a real application, this would be replaced with an actual image file.

For development, you can:
1. Use any image URL for product images
2. Add actual image files to the public directory
3. Use a service like Cloudinary or AWS S3 for image hosting
